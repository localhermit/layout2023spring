    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>
        My game is a survival game similar to Doodle Jump, Helix Jump, Tmple Run, or Google Dino Run. The main objective of the game is to not die and collect as many coins as possible to buy different skins for the character. The game difficulty rises as player move further into the game, so more obstacles preventing them from surviving. The player only needs to navigate obstacles by controlling the chaaracter's ability to dodge and jump while also collecting coins.
